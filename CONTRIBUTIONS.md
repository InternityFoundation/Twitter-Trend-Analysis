We welcome contributions from anyone, even if you are new to open source. If you are new and looking for some way to contribute, a good place to start is to look at the issues tagged 'Easy to Fix'. Once you are interested to work on an issue, ask the mentors if it's been assigned to anyone, if not, get that issue assigned to you and start working on the issue. You can find all the project related issues at [Issues](https://github.com/InternityFoundation/Twitter-Trend-Analysis/issues)
